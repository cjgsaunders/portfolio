This site is made with vanilla html, CSS and JavaScript. No libraries were used for the project.

I wanted to reduce the waiting time from http GET requests because there is not much content on the site, but I prefer the aesthetic of a multi-page site to a single page one.

The solution was one html file with JavaScript displaying the correct elements when links are clicked.

One challenge I enjoyed I was creating JS function that enables the back button to work correctly.
